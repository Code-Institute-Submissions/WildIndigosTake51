     The merchandise section can be found by clicking “Products” on the navigation bar. Upon arrival to the products page, user can use scroll feature to find the specific card for bracelets. 
     The user will then be greeted with a “Coming Soon” button as this is MS1 and I have yet to learn how to implement a wide variety of products or a shopping cart.

    The body products section can be found by clicking “Products” on the navigation bar. Upon arrival to the products page, user can use scroll feature to find the specific card for bracelets.

 # Credits


*	Code Institute

*	ALL of the Tutors who have helped me up to this point.

*	Slack. For where would any new developers be without Slack? Shoutout to old school developers that had to learn without that support system. 
    Specifically Anna Greaves and Simen Daehlin aka "Grandmaster Yoda," as it is always, at least 95% of the time, their answers that pop-up when I search for something on Slack. 
    Those two could run the entire code world. 

*	Ignatius Ukwuoma, my mentor, for helping to guide me through ideas for my project and giving me motivation.

*	Jim Lynx for helping me sort out a bracket and CSS issues as well as the valuable feedback and advice when I was ready to quit. Jim should be hired immediately at
    Code Institute as a mentor upon completion... or now for MS1 projects. 

*	Kevin Powell and his very awesome and concise videos. 

*	Learn Code Institute for their videos as well.


(In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.)
