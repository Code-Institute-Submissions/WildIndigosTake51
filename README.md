# WildIndigosTake51

User Experience
I want the user to come in and immediately be inticed by beutiful nature and moon pictures.

My demographic will be the proverbial hippies, witches, and natural healing gurus. This demographic wants to feel like they have entered in a type of magical 
new realm. i am trying to achieve thislook without making it too busy and or complicated.


NAVBAR
Nav bar was created using bootstrap components. I went with the horizontal option because I thought it
 would stand apart from the focal point of the website yet prominent enough to be easily seen.

 Added Wild Indigos image created by Shantel Vargas. 

 Added footer with social links to help easily click over to our sites.
